# Titanic Survival Prediction

This is my first data science project where I build a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Description

Using the classic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), this project explores the data, performs feature engineering, and builds a model to predict survival outcomes.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

---

## Dataset Features

- `PassengerId` – Unique ID  
- `Pclass` – Ticket class (1, 2, 3)  
- `Sex` – Gender  
- `Age` – Age in years  
- `SibSp` – # of siblings/spouses aboard  
- `Parch` – # of parents/children aboard  
- `Fare` – Ticket price  
- `Embarked` – Port of Embarkation

---

## Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning (handled missing values in Age, Embarked)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding (Sex, Embarked)
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

---

## Results

- Best Accuracy Achieved: **~78%**  
- Logistic Regression performed well with balanced precision and recall.

## Future Improvements

- Try advanced models (XGBoost, SVM)  
- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  
- Deploy as a web app with Streamlit
